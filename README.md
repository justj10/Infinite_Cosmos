This is my game, called Infinite Cosmos.
It is still very much in development, and I will continue to work on it for a while longer.
Currently Freeplay mode works fine, but in Missions mode, only the first mission works, and even that is not in its final state.
Look forward to more updates in the future. Consider this a 0.2.0 release.
